/**

 * important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of 
 * confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document 
 * Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust
