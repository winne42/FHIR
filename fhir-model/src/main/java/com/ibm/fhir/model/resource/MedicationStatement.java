/**
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may 
 * be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future. 
 * The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a 
 * clinician. A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient 
 * visit or stay. The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription 
 * bottle, or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. 
 * 
 * <p>The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication 
 * administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the 
 * person who administered the medication. A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific. There is no 
 * required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient 
 * is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete 
 * or missing or less precise. As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's 
 * memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. 
 * Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
